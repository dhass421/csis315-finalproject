              On December 3, 1994 – 25 years ago this week – the first
              PlayStation made its global debut in Japan. Starting from a humble
              beginning as an upstart within Sony, Ken Kutaragi and team
              delivered on a vision to elevate video games as a form of
              entertainment that everyone could enjoy, and to make a platform
              for game developers to express their creativity. The original
              PlayStation sold 100,000 units in Japan on its first day and went
              on to become the first-ever home console to surpass 100 million
              units sold globally.
            </p>
            <p>
              We struck a chord with the gaming community because PlayStation
              offered experiences beyond what anyone could ever imagine was
              possible with a home console. From the very start, we opened our
              arms to developers, providing them with the tools and technology
              to create beautiful, expansive worlds, and to experiment with new
              ideas. That approach led to the diversity of games PlayStation is
              known for, a true hallmark for our brand across multiple
              generations of hardware platforms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the past 25 years, PlayStation has stood at the forefront of
              gaming, and I’m honored to have been a part of the team since the
              early days. As I was helping set up the business in Europe, I
              remember having to start from scratch with many things, from
              hiring employees to ordering furniture. Back then, we focused on
              catering to local markets to ensure that a gamer in Poland would
              feel a part of the broader PlayStation community just as much as
              someone in the UK, or Japan, or the U.S. Supported by passionate
              fans all around the world, our business has grown significantly
              and our focus on community is more important than ever.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s truly humbling to see fans who grew up on PlayStation passing
              down their love of gaming to their children, who are now playing
              on PS4.
